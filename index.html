    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Hydrata, a hydroponic data tracking app.</p>
    <p>If this is your first time, you'll need to set up the database. Please click on this 
        button to do so: <button class="bttn" onclick='window.location.href="install.php"'>Create Database</button></p>
    <p>This app is designed to keep track of the data for your hydroponic system.
        Hydrata gives you the fields to track the pH, EC, temperature, and your 
        additions. Hydrata also keeps track of the seed that you plant. The alerts are 
        designed to remind you when to plant a new seed.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a section below the data entry and the calendar. This will not display on 
        mobile devices. This is because the amount of data visualized will not fit on a screen 
        too small. Additionally, for data and record keeping, the desktop user will find editing 
        any data easier to do on a desktop device. In case any errors have been made, the desktop 
        version will also produce easier methods to change the data.
    </p>
    <p>
        A note about the calendar. In this release, it is linked to Google Calendar through an API, which is 
        tied to my personal calendar. This has limited features for installing, and the full release will not 
        include Google calendar and instead will have a built in calendar system, making this product self-reliant.
