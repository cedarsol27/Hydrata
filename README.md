# Hydrata
A hydroponic database Tracking web app.
This is my first full web application. I was inspired to build this because I have a hydroponic setup at home for several crops. 
Keeping track of data is of use in many cases, and while this is currently a public app for review, the final version will be intented to use 
only for personal useage.

Part of this project is intended to use an API. In this case I am using Google Calendar API to store reminder data. I'm also using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript,
jQuery, and CSS. There may be other versions in the future intended for commercial development.

There will be further updates including a better internal calendar (no API), data to represent optimal chemical analysis, harvest times, and perhaps expand 
for soil farming and regions. Additionally, the CSS and design layout may be improved as well.
